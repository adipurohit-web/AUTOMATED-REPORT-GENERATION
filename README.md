## 📖 Project Overview
As part of my internship at **Codtech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**, Task 2 involved creating a system to **automated report generation**. The objective was to build a Python script that could read structured data from a file, analyze it, and produce a **professional PDF report** automatically.  

This task was highly practical because automated report generation is widely used in industries such as **finance, healthcare, research, and IT** where large amounts of data need to be processed and presented quickly. Instead of manually preparing reports, automation ensures consistency, accuracy, and efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Read data from a file (CSV, TXT, or JSON).  
2. Analyze the dataset and generate key insights.  
3. Create a structured and formatted PDF report.  
4. Apply basic styling for professional presentation.  
5. Ensure reusability for different datasets.

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
The project was implemented step by step using Python and popular libraries.  

1. **Data Input and Analysis:**  
   - Used **Pandas** to read data from a `.csv` file.  
   - Performed operations such as calculating totals, averages, and basic statistics.  
   - Identified trends and patterns in the dataset.  

2. **Report Design:**  
   - Selected **ReportLab** library for generating PDF reports.  
   - Added elements such as title, headings, paragraphs, and tables.  
   - Incorporated charts and graphs generated using **Matplotlib** for better visualization.  

3. **Output Generation:**  
   - A final **PDF report** (`sales_report.pdf`) was created automatically after running the script.  
   - The report included a cover page, data summary, graphs, and conclusions.
